# Machine_Learning
This is my repository for CS4375 assignments.

## Overview of ML
This [document](Overview_of_ML.pdf) contains an introduction to machine learning terms and information about why I am interested in machine learning.

## Portfolio 1: C++ Data Exploration
This [program](./Portfolio1-Data_Exploration/stats.cpp) reads from the [Boston.csv](./Portfolio1-Data_Exploration/Boston.csv) file and outputs the statistics of the data, including mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation. Read this [document](./Portfolio1-Data_Exploration/Data_Exploration.pdf) to view the output of my program and learn more about the significance of these statistical measures.

## Portfolio 2: Linear Models
This assignment involved exploring and fitting linear models to two datasets. This [pdf](./Portfolio2-Linear_Models/Regression.pdf) shows the code for fitting three different types of linear regression models to a data set about traffic volume. This [pdf](./Portfolio2-Linear_Models/Classification.pdf) shows how to fit a logistic regression model and a naive bayes model to a data set about a population of adults.

## Portfolio 3: ML Algorithms From Scratch
This assignment involved implementing the [Logistic Regression](./Portfolio3-ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch/LogReg.cpp) and [Naive Bayes](./Portfolio3-ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch/NaiveBayes.cpp) algorithms from scratch on the [titanic data set](./Portfolio3-ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch/titanic_project.csv). Read this [report](./Portfolio3-ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch/ML_Algorithms_from_Scratch.pdf) to learn more about both of these programs.

## Portfolio 4: Searching for Similarity
This assignment involved comparing the results of multiple algorithms for [regression](./Portfolio4-Search_For_Similarity/Regression.pdf), [classification](./Portfolio4-Search_For_Similarity/Classification.pdf), [clustering](./Portfolio4-Search_For_Similarity/Clustering.pdf), and [dimensionality reduction](./Portfolio4-Search_For_Similarity/Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf). This [document](./Portfolio4-Search_For_Similarity/Narrative.pdf) explains how each of the algorithms implemented in this portfolio work.

## Portfolio 5: Kernel and Ensemble Methods
This assignment involved peforming machine learning using SVM kernels and Ensemble methods. This [pdf](./Portfolio5-Kernel_Ensemble_Methods/Regression.pdf) contains an implementation of SVM Regression using a linear, polynomial, and radial kernels on a regression datset. This [pdf](./Portfolio5-Kernel_Ensemble_Methods/Classification.pdf) performs the same algorithms, but on a classification datset. This [pdf](./Portfolio5-Kernel_Ensemble_Methods/Ensemble.pdf) compares the performances of three ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Adabag) to a simple Decision Tree algorithm on a classification dataset. See this [document](./Portfolio5-Kernel_Ensemble_Methods/Narrative.pdf) to learn about how SVM kernels and the three ensemble methods work and the advantages and disadvanatges of each technique.

## Portfolio 6: ML with sklearn
This assignment involved performing machine learning in Python using the sklearn library. This [pdf](./Portfolio6-ML_with_sklearn/ML_with_sklearn.pdf) compares the results from three classification algorithms from Python's sklearn library: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network.
