# Machine_Learning
This is my repository for CS4375 assignments.

## Overview of ML
This [document](Overview_of_ML.pdf) contains an introduction to machine learning terms and information about why I am interested in machine learning.

## Portfolio 1: C++ Data Exploration
This [program](./Portfolio1-Data_Exploration/stats.cpp) reads from the [Boston.csv](./Portfolio1-Data_Exploration/Boston.csv) file and outputs the statistics of the data, including mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation. Read this [document](./Portfolio1-Data_Exploration/Data_Exploration.pdf) to view the output of my program and learn more about the significance of these statistical measures.

## Portfolio 2: Linear Models
This assignment involved exploring and fitting linear models to two datasets. This [pdf](./Portfolio2-Linear_Models/Regression.pdf) shows the code for fitting three different types of linear regression models to a data set about traffic volume. This [pdf](./Portfolio2-Linear_Models/Classification.pdf) shows how to fit a logistic regression model and a naive bayes model to a data set about a population of adults.

## Portfolio 3: ML Algorithms From Scratch
This assignment involved implementing the [Logistic Regression](./Portfolio3-ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch/LogReg.cpp) and [Naive Bayes](./Portfolio3-ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch/NaiveBayes.cpp) algorithms from scratch on the [titanic data set](./Portfolio3-ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch/titanic_project.csv). Read this report to learn more about both of these programs.
